# Muhammad Nauval Muzaki - Portfolio
## Data Analyst | Data-Driven Solutions

As a third-year Statistics major, I bring a robust foundation in data analysis, visualization, and organization. My passion for data analytics is demonstrated through my strong analytical skills, having knowledge of developing Deep Learning and classic Machine Learning fundamentals, honed by hands-on experience in interpreting complex data sets. My academic journey has been marked by continuous growth in the use of advanced statistical tools, preparing me for challenging roles in the field of data analytics.

## Top Projects

### Bike Sharing Data Analysis
Description: This dashboard is a powerful tool designed to provide comprehensive insights into bike sharing systems usage patterns and trends. This interactive dashboard leverages data visualization techniques to present key metrics and analytics in a user-friendly interface, catering to both casual users and data enthusiasts alike.
- [Link to Dashboard](https://dashboard-bikesharing-nauval.streamlit.app/): Interactive dashbord for accessing the data visualization of the Bike Sharing Data Analysis Project.
Requirements: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit.
Results: trend of total bike users in 2011 is having uptrend until June, and having down after June to December. For total bike users in 2012 we can see that the trend is still indicating uptrend until September and have some sharp downtrend until December.

### Data Wrangling
Description: Data wrangling is the process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning raw data into a format suitable for analysis. I also change the variable name to the suitable name for easier analysis.
Requirements: Python, Pandas, MySQL.
Result: The clean data without missing values, duplicate data, and inaccurate values so data suitable to be explored and for further analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization
Description: Provides summary statistics and descriptive statistics about the dataset, identifying patterns and trends present in the data through visualizations.
Requirements: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Result: There are many tables and chart shown in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard-bikesharing-nauval.streamlit.app/).

### Forecasting
Description: Used Exponential Smoothing (trying without using Machine Learning algorithm).
Requirements: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Result: After december 2012, the trend of the total bike users tend to a bit uptrend. and the forecast pattern during following the actual data visually following the pattern.
